NOTES:    PostFix, InFix, Operator & Operand Definitions:

In all computer languages, expressions consist of two types of components: 
operands and operators. Operands are the objects that are manipulated and 
operators are the symbols that represent specific actions. 
For example, in the expression

5 + 9

9 and 5 are operands and + is an operator. 
All expressions have at least one operand. 

Infix:  
Infix calculators expect two operands separated by an operator:
5 + 9

the results of which = 14.

In Postfix, or RPN, the operators follow the operands:

5 9 +

the results are the same.

For order dependent functions the top operand is Y, the next operand is X:

5 9 -

operator = '-'
X = '5'
Y = '9'

POSTFIX(X Y -)  ==  INFIX(X - Y)  ==  INFIX(5 - 9)  ==  -4
